## Overview

  Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ajor Moses, Thanks for checking out my front-end coding challenge.

### The challenge
  
  The challenge is to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
  
  Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot
  
  The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

  The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

  If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

  You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

  There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts

## My process
  
  1. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
  2. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
  3. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `outfit` and `11px`.
  4. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 


### What I learned
  
  I learnt more on how to apply pseudo-class to a background image.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.fonts.google.com) - This helped me for linking my the font-family 'outfit' to my code. 

- [Resource 2](https://www.www3schools.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand how to apply pseudo-classes. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
